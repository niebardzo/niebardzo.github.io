Since, I started my career at IT, I found my passion in InfoSec. In every organization I join, I try to make as much postive impact on general InfoSec posture as I can. I started my work as Security Compliance Analyst, then move to Cyber Security Analyst Role where I advise the organization by performing technical assessment on internal project. At September 2019, I have finished MSc in Applied Computer Science @ AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. At January 2020, I have completed [OSCP certification] (https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), which I recommend eveyone to take. Now, I focus on offenisve security of web and mobile application and fuzzing of binaries to find memory corrupion bugs and generally make software more secure.
